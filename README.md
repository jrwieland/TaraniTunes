TaraniTunes v4.1 (color radios) and v3.01 (non-color radios)
===========
*This is a separate advanced version from the Original TaraniTunes developed by [GilDev](https://github.com/GilDev).     
GilDev and I agreed that both versions of the script (the original and this advanced version) would be available for users but hosted separately.*

## 2/11/2021 I have moved the files to a new repository so others can find it when doing a search in github.     

Here is the new repository location     
[TaraniTunes-v4x](https://github.com/jrwieland/TaraniTunes-v4.x)
